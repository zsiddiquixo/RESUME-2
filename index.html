        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I am thrilled to express my prolonged interest in baking as a cake decorator at Just Add Flour in North Vancouver, BC. With four years of at-home baking experience and non-professional cake baking/decorating, I am confident in my qualifications to work as a baker at Just Add Flour and believe that it will enhance my skills. During my time at my sister-in-laws at home baking business called Fatty Sweets N Treats, I have successfully created a status within my close family and friends, whom have spread the word of my desserts. Throughout the five months I spent assisting this business, I have learnt many new skills and have received daily orders. The business mainly specialized in decorated/and or stuffed waffles however sold cakes and cupcakes as well. Moreover, my customer service experience can be significantly effective in a bakery work place as I have frequently taken orders over the phone and in person, and I have professionally managed any problems or concerns that have crossed the customers. Therefore, my extensive experience in baking would be exceptionally beneficial for this role. Ultimately, I believe I am an excellent fit for the position of a cake decorator and baker at Just Add Flour due to all of my past experience and intense passion for baking. I would be exhilarated to have offered this opportunity and will present my best effort. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
